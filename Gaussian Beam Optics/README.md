# Gaussian Beam Optics

In this experiment, equipment and techniques commonly employed in optics laboratories will be utilized. Optical components will be assembled and aligned, followed by the establishment of a straightforward optical system to characterize a laser beam. The Gaussian beam model is frequently employed to describe light beams generated by lasers, and its validity for one of the HeNe lasers will be examined in this experiment. The intensity profile of the laser beam will be determined using the slit method, while the knife-edge method will be employed to measure the beam diameter in relation to propagation distance. These techniques are especially valuable for beams exhibiting an approximately Gaussian intensity profile.
